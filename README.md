# MPDHub
A repository of Model Pathway Diagrams

This repository contains a collection of MPDs for various models (and standardizes their
identitiers). The repository is organized as follows:

* ```models``` contains the MPDs for various models. For every model there is a subdir (the name is the provisional model identifier) which contains
  * source and image files for the MPDs
  * a description of the model
  * bibliographic referernces
* ```tools``` contains subdirs for software tools (eventually)
* ```specification``` (coming soon, see the CICM paper in the meantime)B
* the wiki of the repos binds them all together.
